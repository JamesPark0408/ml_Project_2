# Project:
Build and critically analyse sueprvised Machine Learning Methods to predict the sentiment of Tweets (Neutral, Negative, Positive) given dataset of tweets with annotated sentiments. 

Implementation of Machine Learning Methods:
- Preprocessing
- Feature Selection
- Training models used: 
    - One-R
    - Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes (MNB)
    - Random Forest (RF)
    - Logistic Regression (LR)
    - Ensemble (Stacking)
- Test and Evaluate 
    - F1 weighted score
    - Accuracy
